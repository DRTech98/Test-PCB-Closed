# Test-PCB-WIP-
A PCB I designed to test a custom footprint I made for an 8-SOP IC LED driver. 
This LED driver can handle up to 2.32W meaning that at 80% capacity the IC can withstand 1.856W. 
Using a 12V power supply, LEDs are placed 3 at a time in parallel. 
The LED sign I created of my name could be improved through an LED driver, seeing as LED drivers are often used as constant current sources. 
This constant current source can make the LEDs appear at the exact same brightness with little to no difference in current draw in each column. 
Project includes schematic and layout of the PCB. This project is a work in progress and is currently missing the following:

1. Bill of Materials.
2. PCB prototpye from JLC PCB.
3. Datasheets of components used.
4. Pictures and video demonstration of a working prototype.
