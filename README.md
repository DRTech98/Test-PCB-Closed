# Test-PCB-Work In Progress-
A PCB I designed to test a custom footprint I made for an 8-SOP IC LED driver. 
This LED driver can handle up to 2.32W meaning that at 80% capacity the IC can withstand 1.856W. 
Using a 12V power supply, LEDs are placed 3 at a time in parallel. 
The LED sign I created of my name could be improved through an LED driver, seeing as LED drivers are often used as constant current sources. 
This constant current source can make the LEDs appear at the exact same brightness with little to no difference in current draw in each column. 
For this project, I created a footprint and schematic symbol seeing as KiCad did not orignally have this component in its library. 
The schematic symbol and footprint dimensions were based of its respective data sheet. The purpose of this project was to learn
how to make a proper footprint and schematic symbol from scratch and to test the components selected for the driver and
see if the LEDs work accordingly. LED driver was soldered on with a rework station and the rest of the components
were soldered on with a soldering iron. Project includes schematic, PCB, BOM, and report discussing how I created the 
circuit and my reasoning for selecting certain components (report is currently a work in progress).
